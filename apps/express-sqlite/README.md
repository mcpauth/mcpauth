# Express SQLite Example App

This example application demonstrates how to use `@mcpauth/auth` with Express and the SQLite adapter.

This example is based on the Express example from `next-auth`. You can find the original example [here](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/apps/examples/express).
